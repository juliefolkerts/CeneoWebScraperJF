        <h2>About the Ceneo Webscraper Project</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Ceneo Webscraper project homepage! This project is designed to help users quickly and easily find reviews for products listed on <a href="https://www.ceneo.pl" target="_blank">Ceneo.pl</a>, a popular Polish price comparison website.</p>
        
        <p>Using my web application, you can simply enter the product code of any item you're interested in, and the system will fetch and display the reviews available on Ceneo.pl. This can help you make informed purchasing decisions by providing you with genuine user feedback.</p>
        
        <p>The Ceneo Webscraper is built using the following technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML</strong> - for the structure of the web pages.</li>
            <li><strong>Flask</strong> - a lightweight web framework for Python, which powers the backend.</li>
            <li><strong>Bootstrap</strong> - for a responsive and modern CSS design, ensuring the site looks great on all devices.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I hope you find this tool helpful!</p>
